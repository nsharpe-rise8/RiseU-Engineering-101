# Chapter 5: Testing and Quality Assurance

Welcome to Chapter 5 of RiseU! This chapter dives into essential testing and quality assurance practices in software development. By the end, you'll know how to apply unit, integration, and end-to-end testing methods, embrace Test-Driven Development (TDD), maintain quality test cases, utilize automation tools, and promote continuous improvement for ensuring software excellence.

## Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand software testing levels: Unit, Integration, E2E, and TDD.
- Recognize the value of effective test cases, including Gherkin examples.
- Assess and improve testing skills.
- Apply best practices for quality software delivery.
- Encourage ongoing learning and enhancement in testing practices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following set up:

- Riser Chat UI/API setup and configured to run locally
- `Jest` and `React Testing Library` documentation for troubleshooting and further research

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Understanding Unit Testing

**The Nature of a Unit:** At its core, a unit in software development is akin to a single, self-contained function or method within a class or module. It's designed to perform a specific task, characterized by its inputs and outputs or actions. The beauty of a unit lies in its simplicity and focusâ€”a testament to the single responsibility principle. It doesn't worry about the larger system it's a part of; rather, it concentrates on executing its designated task well, given specific inputs.

**The Purpose of Unit Testing:** Unit testing serves as a microscope under which each unit's behavior is examined and verified. By writing tests for these small, discrete units of code, developers gain a profound understanding of what outputs or behaviors to expect for given inputs. This scrutiny reveals potential uncaught exceptions or inaccuracies in the unit's output, essentially gauging the function's predictability and reliability.

**Integration and Isolation:** One of the hallmarks of well-designed unit tests is the ability to modify or replace a unit without affecting the integrity of other units within the system. This is achievable when units are designed with clear, isolated responsibilities. Well-tested units, when integrated, form a cohesive system where changes are localized, minimizing the risk of unintended side effects across the system.

#### 2. Practice Unit Testing

Lets start unit testing our application code. We'll start with `riser-chat-ui`, specifically

Test Cases for the App Component
Render Test: Verify that the App component renders without crashing. This test ensures that all child components are mounted successfully.

Layout Integrity: Check that the main layout components (AppBar, Drawer, Toolbar, and Container) are present. This involves querying for each component based on role or text content and asserting their presence.

Style and Structure Verification: Since the App component utilizes sx props for styling, particularly with the Drawer and main container, verify that these elements adopt the specified styles. For instance, ensure the Drawer has the correct width as dictated by drawerWidth.

ChatInterface Component: Ensure the ChatInterface component is rendered within the Container. This can be achieved by querying for elements specific to ChatInterface or ensuring the Container's direct child is the ChatInterface component.

Theme Consistency: Since the AppBar's zIndex is set to be one more than the theme's drawer zIndex, you can test if the applied style matches this specification. This involves checking the computed style of the AppBar and comparing it to the expected value.

Responsive Design Test: Verify that the Box component that serves as the main content container adjusts its width according to the drawerWidth. This can be simulated by adjusting the viewport size and checking the Box component's width.

Sample Test Code Snippet
Here's an example of how a test for the layout integrity might look using @testing-library/react:

```javascript
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import App from "./App";

test("renders AppBar and ChatInterface", () => {
  render(<App />);

  // Check for AppBar presence
  const appBarElement = screen.getByRole("banner");
  expect(appBarElement).toBeInTheDocument();

  // Check for Drawer presence
  const drawerElement = screen.getByRole("presentation"); // Assuming role is set or use query based on text/class
  expect(drawerElement).toBeInTheDocument();

  // Check for ChatInterface presence by querying an element unique to ChatInterface
  const chatInterfaceElement = screen.getByTestId("chat-interface"); // Assuming 'data-testid' is set in ChatInterface
  expect(chatInterfaceElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
