# Chapter 2: Agile and Team Collaboration

## Objectives

By completing this chapter, you will:

- Understand the foundational Agile Methodologies and the specific Rise8 Agile Principles.
- Explore the dynamics of Agile and Team Collaboration.
- Recognize the responsibilities within Agile teams, including partner engagement and portfolio leadership.
- Appreciate the value of a Balanced Team in integrating Design, Product, and Engineering efforts.
- Master the planning processes and point systems that drive workload management and prioritization.
- Learn the nuances of sprints, from pre-planning to demonstrations, and the importance of collecting user feedback.

## Introduction to Agile

[Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) is a modern approach to software development that enables teams to deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a sequential, linear process, Agile encourages adaptive planning, evolutionary development, continual improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

In this chapter, we'll explore how Agile principles apply in the context of team collaboration and project management. We'll dissect how the principles and practices of Agile can not only improve the quality of software but also enhance the productivity and engagement of Agile teams.

### Rise8 Agile Principles

TODO: Write them here

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Balanced Teams

TODO: Discuss how a balanced team approach fosters collaboration between different disciplines to create better product outcomes.

## Types of Work

TODO: Explain breakdown of types of work including feature/bug/chore/spike

## Delivery and Feedback

TODO: Cover project-level deadlines and the importance of realistic estimations to ensure timely delivery.

## Sprint Execution

- Outline the typical sprint cycle, including task estimation, story points, and workloads, while highlighting the subjective nature of points.
- Understand the role of sprint reviews and demonstrations in gathering critical user feedback for continuous product improvement.

### Pre-Sprint Planning

Learn how to break down large tasks into smaller ones, assign points, and establish a shared understanding before the sprint begins.

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a development technique where two developers author software using the same computer. In a remote environment, one user can share the screen with another via collaboration software such as Zoom or Live Share. There are two roles in pair programming:

- Driver: The person who is writing the code. 
- Navigator: The person who helps the driver navigate the code development process. They can write code in the form of suggestions or corrections.

Pairing helps train inexperienced devs, allows for the propagation of tips and techniques, and provides accountability.

Here are a few helpful hints when pairing:

- Pairing can be tiring, take breaks often.
- Rotate pairs regularly. Each person brings something unique to the table which will improve the codebase as a whole. Swapping pairs also drives both knowledge sharing and alignment across the team.
- Be open to new ideas and constructive criticism.
- Sometimes pairing might not be the best approach. Feel free to solo when it makes sense. But remember, committed code requires a peer review.
