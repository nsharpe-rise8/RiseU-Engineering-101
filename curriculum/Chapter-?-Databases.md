# Chapter ?: Databases

## Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand the role and importance of databases in application development.
- Differentiate between graph, document, and relational-based databases.

## Understanding Database Types

Databases can broadly be categorized based on the data model they use:

### Relational Databases: 
Use tables to store data. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used for managing and querying data. Examples include PostgreSQL and MySQL.
### Document Databases: 
Store data in JSON-like documents, making them flexible for development. MongoDB is a popular document database.
### Graph Databases: 
Utilize graph structures for semantic queries, ideal for interconnected data. Examples are Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.
